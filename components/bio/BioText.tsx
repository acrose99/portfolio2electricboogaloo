            Specifically, my greatest passion is innovation within the digital
            humanities. It‚Äôs a way to use programming for good by educating
            people about new subjects. To this end I did a fellowship making a
            project about the History of Computing as a Junior, and I‚Äôm
            currently working on an digitial exhibit about the Black Panthers
            for the Chicago History Museum, which should be unveiled later in
            2022 or 2023 (contact me if you want more info).

            it helps me feel productive. Thus, I have a few side projects you
